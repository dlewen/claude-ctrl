#!/usr/bin/env bash
# backfill-token-history.sh — Retroactively add project_hash and project_name
# (columns 6+7) to existing .session-token-history entries.
#
# Purpose: Old-format entries in .session-token-history have only 5 columns:
#   timestamp|total_tokens|main_tokens|subagent_tokens|session_id
#
# This script upgrades them to 7 columns by matching each entry's timestamp
# to the closest trace in traces/index.jsonl (within ±30 minutes) and using
# that trace's project_name and computing its project_hash. Unmatched entries
# get "unknown" as project_name and empty string as project_hash.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/backfill-token-history.sh [history_file] [trace_index]
#
# Defaults:
#   history_file: ~/.claude/.session-token-history
#   trace_index:  ~/.claude/traces/index.jsonl
#
# Behavior:
#   - Backs up the original file to <history_file>.bak
#   - Skips entries already having 7 columns (idempotent)
#   - Reports N backfilled, M skipped (already 7-col), P unmatched
#   - Overwrites the history file in-place (after successful processing)
#
# @decision DEC-BACKFILL-TOKEN-HISTORY-001
# @title Backfill script adds project_hash/name columns to old token history
# @status accepted
# @rationale Existing history files pre-date issue #160. Without backfill, the
# per-project filter in session-init.sh would treat all old entries as "unscoped"
# and include them in every project's sum — inflating each project's lifetime count.
# The backfill assigns the most likely project based on trace timestamps, reducing
# the unscoped set. Entries more than 30 minutes from any trace stay unscoped
# (backward-compat: still counted for all projects) rather than being silently
# dropped. The 30-minute window is generous: most sessions produce traces within
# a few minutes of the token history entry.

# (full path). Computing phash("my-project") will NOT match phash("/Users/me/my-project")
# from session-end.sh. This is an acceptable limitation for backfill: the goal is to
# associate old entries with a project_name for human readability, not to enable
# accurate per-project filtering for those old entries. Old entries already fall through
# the (NF < 6) backward-compat clause in session-init.sh anyway. A future enhancement
# could cross-reference with session archive paths, but the complexity isn't justified
# for historical data.
