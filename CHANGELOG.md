## [3.0.0] - 2026-03-07

### Added
- `feature/sqlite-w1`: SQLite WAL-based state store (Wave 1) — rewrite hooks/state-lib.sh with sqlite3 backend (state_update, state_read, state_cas, state_delete, workflow_id), WAL mode with busy_timeout=5000ms, per-workflow isolation via workflow_id column, SQL injection prevention, lattice-enforced CAS, legacy jq functions preserved as _legacy_* for Wave 2 migration; 20-test suite in test-sqlite-state.sh covering schema, CRUD, CAS, lattice, concurrency, and injection; `--scope sqlite` in run-hooks.sh (DEC-SQLITE-001 through DEC-SQLITE-010, closes #128, #129)
- `feature/sqlite-state-store`: SQLite Unified State Store initiative added to MASTER_PLAN.md — 4-wave implementation plan replacing scattered flat-file state with single SQLite WAL database, 8 architectural decisions (DEC-SQLITE-001 through 008), 9 P0 requirements, issues #128-#134
- `feature/lint-on-write`: Multi-language lint-on-write hook (hooks/lint.sh) — synchronous PostToolUse on Write/Edit runs shellcheck/ruff/go vet/cargo clippy with CI-matching exclusions, 3s cooldown per file, linter install suggestions; Check 6b post-commit shellcheck advisory in check-guardian.sh; 38 lint-scope tests in run-hooks.sh; fix SC2116 and SC2059 x2 in existing scripts (DEC-LINT-001)
- `feature/dispatch-enforcement-tests`: Orchestrator guard test suite — 8 tests across 6 scenarios for Gate 1.5 (DEC-DISPATCH-003): deny orchestrator, allow subagent, backward compat (missing SID), non-source bypass, and protected file registry (DEC-TEST-ORCH-GUARD-001)
- `feature/dispatch-enforcement`: Gate 1.5 in pre-write.sh blocks orchestrator from writing source code directly — compares CLAUDE_SESSION_ID against .orchestrator-sid (written by session-init.sh) to detect orchestrator context; dispatch routing table restored to CLAUDE.md; .orchestrator-sid lifecycle managed by session-init/session-end (DEC-DISPATCH-001, DEC-DISPATCH-002, DEC-DISPATCH-003)

- `feature/dispatch-gate`: Gate 0 (dispatch-confirmation-deny) in pre-ask.sh — mechanically blocks orchestrator dispatch-confirmation questions ("Want me to dispatch Guardian?") enforcing CLAUDE.md auto-dispatch rules; fires before orchestrator bypass so it catches this specific anti-pattern while allowing legitimate questions through; 3 new test fixtures + 3 new test cases (DEC-ASK-GATE-001 updated)
- `feature/production-reliability`: Production Reliability Phase 4+5 — macOS CI matrix (ubuntu-latest + macos-latest) with 10min timeout, shellcheck extended to tests/ and scripts/; README.md and ARCHITECTURE.md updated from old individual hook names to consolidated entry points (pre-bash.sh, pre-write.sh, post-write.sh, stop.sh)
